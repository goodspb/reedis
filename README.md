# Reedis
Redis GUI for Django user

## Purpose

I am using Django to build a web service involving Redis as the cache server. But after saving the content in Redis, I can't easily read from the Redis string because Django serializes data with `pickle`. 
So I pop up with an idea to build a Redis GUI for a Django user like me.

## Structure

mainly with `QT Pyside6` + `SQLAlchemy`
